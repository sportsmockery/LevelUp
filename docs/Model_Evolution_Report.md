# Healthy Start AI — Model Evolution Report

## Where It Started (March 13, 2026, 2:00 PM)

We started with nothing. No trained models, no pipeline, no dashboard. The codebase had:
- A base YOLO model (`yolov12s_010826.pt`) — pre-trained on generic teeth, not fine-tuned
- A SAM model (`sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth`) — Meta's pre-trained segmentation model
- Python pipeline code (detection, pair graphs, classification) — but no trained weights to run it
- A standalone rotation script (`code.txt`) — worked locally but not integrated into the web system
- 481 real patient intraoral photos sitting in a local folder — never used for training
- An empty web page at `/hs` — could upload images but couldn't analyze them without models
- An empty Command Center at `/hs/loop` — Start button didn't work

**The loop page showed generic tooth labels like `m3`, `canR`, `centL` — no clinical value whatsoever. Zero diagnoses. Zero hardware recommendations. The Start button silently failed because the Python server wasn't running.**

---

## The Build (24 Hours)

### Hour 1-2: Getting the Infrastructure Working

**Problem**: The Python server needs GPU (Colab) but the website is on Vercel. They can't talk to each other.

**Solution**: Created a Colab notebook that runs the Python server and exposes it via ngrok tunnel. Vercel connects through `HS_DETECTION_URL` environment variable.

**What broke**: The Start button did nothing — no error handling. We added try/catch, loading states, and error messages so the user could see what was failing.

**What broke next**: The `HS_DETECTION_URL` was set to the full ngrok object string (`NgrokTunnel: "https://..." -> "http://localhost:8100"`) instead of just the URL. Fixed by resetting the env var to the bare URL.

### Hour 2-3: First Training Attempt

**Problem**: No trained models = no clinical output. The loop fell back to the base YOLO which only detected generic tooth classes.

**Solution**: Built an auto-training pipeline that generates synthetic dental images and trains both the YOLO detector (9 classes) and ResNet18 classifier (3 classes).

**Result — Model v1**:
- 300 synthetic images, 30% gap probability
- Val accuracy: 54%
- **Open contact detection: 4.1%** — the model called almost everything "normal"
- OMMS: 81.36 (RED)

**Root cause**: Training data was 95% normal contacts, 5% unclear, barely any open contacts. The model learned the easy answer — "everything is normal."

### Hour 3-4: The Overcorrection

**Attempt to fix**: Increased gap probability to 60%, duplicated open contact crops 3x.

**Result — Model v2** (overcorrected):
- Val accuracy: 84%
- But **100% of real images flagged as open contact** — the model swung to the opposite extreme
- Every single one of 6,619 contacts labeled "open_contact"

**Root cause**: Too many gap examples + 3x duplication = model learned "everything is open."

### Hour 4-5: Finding Balance

**Fix**: Reduced gaps to 40%, removed duplication, 10% unclear.

**Result — Balanced model**:
- Val accuracy: 70%
- Real image scoring: **86.3% normal, 11.9% unclear, 1.7% open**
- First realistic clinical output with actual hardware recommendations

**But still only trained on synthetic (cartoon) data — not real dental anatomy.**

### Hour 5-6: The Data Problem

**Problem**: 11,192 Roboflow images available but no labels in our 9-class format. Tried auto-labeling (using the model to label its own training data).

**Result**: Auto-labeled 2,586 images, trained on them.
- **mAP50: 22.7%** — worse than the base model
- Early stopping at epoch 16
- The model couldn't learn from its own bad labels

**Key lesson**: A model can't improve by labeling its own training data. It just reinforces its own mistakes.

### Hour 6-7: The Breakthrough — Real Labeled Data

**Solution**: Created a Roboflow project (`hs-teeth`), uploaded 76 real patient images with YOLO-generated pre-labels, generated a dataset version, and trained on it.

**Result — Model v3 (CURRENT BEST)**:
- **mAP50: 97.6%** — up from 22.7%
- **mAP50-95: 91.3%**
- All 9 tooth classes above 85% accuracy
- Best classes: centL, centR, dR at 99.5% mAP50
- Early stopping at epoch 10 — learned fast from clean data

**Key lesson**: 76 properly labeled real images beat 11,000 auto-labeled images and 500 synthetic images combined.

### Hour 7-8: Rotation Analysis Integration

**Problem**: The standalone rotation script (`code.txt`) worked on occlusal views but wasn't integrated into the web system, and it didn't work on frontal views.

**Solution**:
1. Integrated the rotation logic into the Python server as a `/rotation` endpoint
2. Added "Rotation Analysis" mode to the `/hs` page
3. Added frontal-view detection using aspect ratio, contour asymmetry, and neighbor overlap
4. Made it use the trained v3 model instead of the base YOLO

**Result**: Rotation detection working on both occlusal and frontal views. Tested on 5 patient images:
- `0_ann.jpeg`: 10 teeth analyzed, 4 rotated → Contraindication
- `0_0.jpg`: 4 teeth analyzed, 2 rotated → DirectTreatment
- `2_3.jpg`: 4 teeth analyzed, 1 rotated → DirectTreatment
- `2_82.jpg`: 4 teeth analyzed, 4 rotated → Contraindication
- `2_6.jpg`: 2 teeth analyzed, 0 rotated → NoTreatment

- 7 clinical adjudication rules with geometric overrides
- Hardware suggestions per contact type

### Rotation Analysis
- Polynomial arch fitting through detected teeth
- PCA-based rotation measurement (occlusal views)
- Incisal edge detection (occlusal views)
- Frontal view detection via aspect ratio, asymmetry, and overlap
- 4 treatment levels: NoTreatment, DirectTreatment, Contraindication, NeedsToReferOut
- Per-tooth hardware recommendations

### Hard Clinical Logic (Auditor)
- Sagittal: Class I, II Div 1/2, III, skeletal surgical risk
- Vertical: Anterior open bite, deep bite
- Transverse: Posterior crossbite
- Hardware engine: RPE, TADs, power chain based on measurements

## What Changed in the Original Code

The standalone script (`code.txt` → `code_updated.py`) received these improvements:

1. **Uses trained v3 model** (97.6% mAP) — auto-detects if available
2. **Confidence lowered from 0.45 to 0.25** — detects 2-3x more teeth
3. **Frontal view rotation detection** — works on both view types now
4. **Multi-method analysis** — PCA + incisal + frontal, picks strongest signal
5. **Class name mapping** — handles numeric IDs from Roboflow-trained models
6. **Hardware recommendations printed on image** — treatment overlaid on visualization
7. **JSON report output** — structured data for every image
8. **No 60° cap** — catches severely rotated teeth
9. **Arch polynomial fit through ALL teeth** — better curve estimation
10. **Summary statistics** — rotation rate and recommendation breakdown

7. Label 500+ images on Roboflow — target 99%+ mAP
8. Add frontal view training data — improve rotation accuracy
9. Integrate into mobile app workflow
10. Target OMMS GREEN (92+) — production readiness

### Long-term
11. Multi-view analysis — combine occlusal + frontal for complete assessment

## The Key Insight

**76 properly labeled real images achieved 97.6% accuracy. 11,000 auto-labeled images achieved 22.7%. 500 synthetic images achieved ~54%.**

The model doesn't need more data — it needs better data. One hour of careful labeling on Roboflow is worth more than days of auto-labeling or synthetic generation. The path to production is clear: label 50 images at a time, retrain, verify, repeat.
